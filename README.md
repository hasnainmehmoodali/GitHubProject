Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in code and collaborating on software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, manage different versions of the code, and merge changes efficiently. Git enables branching, which helps in experimenting with new features without affecting the main codebase. It is widely used in software development and integrates with platforms like GitHub and GitLab for remote repository management.
